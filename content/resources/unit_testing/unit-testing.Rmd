# Exercises: Unit testing in R

In this document we will learn how to use unit testing in R with the testthat package.

### Setting up unit testing

You will need to have already set up a package containing functions to test (in the `R/` folder).
See the Workflow practical for how to do this if you haven't yet.
In the same way that a package can be set up using the `usethis` package helper functions we can also easily set up the unit testing framework with this package.

From inside of your package run

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_testthat()
```

This does three things:

* Creates a `tests/testthat directory`

* Adds testthat to the `Suggests` field in the `DESCRIPTION`

* Creates a file `tests/testthat.R` that runs all your tests when you execute `devtools::check()`

### First unit test

We will write some tests for the `p_matrix_cycle()` function which created a transition probability matrix. Make sure that this function is included in your package and you have run `load_all()`.
To create our first test file write

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_test("p_matrix_cycle")
```

Here, we name this file the same as our function name but you can call it whatever you find useful. This creates a new file under `tests/ testthat` named `test-p_matrix_cycle.R`, i.e. it prepends `test-` to the file name, and the file pre-populates with an example test that we can replace.

For our first unit test, we will create an object that contains the expected results of an example function execution, and then we assess the correctness of the output using the `testthat::expect_*` functions.

We name the overall test chunk `assess_p_matrix_cycle` - you can name this whatever would be useful for you to read in a testing log.
We first need to provide some input values for the test.

```{r eval=FALSE}
t_names <- c("without_drug", "with_drug")
n_treatments <- length(t_names)

s_names  <- c("Asymptomatic_disease", "Progressive_disease", "Dead")
n_states <- length(s_names)

p_matrix <- array(data = 0,
                  dim = c(n_states, n_states, n_treatments),
                  dimnames = list(from = s_names,
                                  to = s_names,
                                  t_names))
# transition matrix variables
tpProg <- 0.01
tpDcm <- 0.15
tpDn <- 0.0138
effect <- 0.5
```

In this test, we evaluate if the function returns the correct type of object, in this case, a double

```{r eval=FALSE}
test_that("assess_p_matrix_cycle", {
  res <- p_matrix_cycle(p_matrix, age = 50, cycle = 1)
  expect_type(res, "double")
})
```

There are two ways to execute the test.

* The _Run Tests_ button on the top right hand side of the testing script executes the tests in this script only (not all tests in the package), and executes this in a fresh R environment.

* Submitting `devtools::test()` (or _Ctrl + Shift + T_) executes all tests in the package in your global environment.

#### Testing for errors

Next, let us test what happens when we change the ages argument.
What would we expect to happen for the following ages?
It clearly makes no sense to have someone aged -1 or 1000 years old so what should the code do if this is the case? Error with a helpful message? Use a default value instead and give a warning message?

```{r eval=FALSE}
test_that("assess_p_matrix_cycle", {
  res <- p_matrix_cycle(p_matrix, age = -1, cycle = 1)
  # expect_error(res)?
  # expect_warning(res)?
  # expect_message(res)?
  
  res <- p_matrix_cycle(p_matrix, age = 1000, cycle = 1)
  expect_type(res, "double")
})
```

In fact you'll see that the function just carries on regardless without indicating to us that anything is wrong and instead has `NA` values for some of the probabilities.
This is more obvious in the above case but see what happens for aged 20 years old individuals.

```{r eval=FALSE}
test_that("assess_p_matrix_cycle", {
  res <- p_matrix_cycle(p_matrix, age = 20, cycle = 1)
  expect_type(res, "double")
})
```

__Why is this?__

The ages look up table only starts at 34 years old so a 20 year old is treated the same as 1000 year old.

Let's add in some code to  `p_matrix_cycle` to catch this.

Include the following to the first line and then `load_all()` the package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (age < 34) stop("age must be at between 34 and 100")
```

Now if we rerun the tests we can check that a 20 year old throws an error and what the error message is.

```{r eval=FALSE}
test_that("assess_p_matrix_cycle", {
  res <- p_matrix_cycle(p_matrix, age = 20, cycle = 1)
  expect_error(res, regexp = "age must be at between 34 and 100")
})
```


#### Test for probabilities

`p_matrix_cycle` returns a probability matrix so let us now test that they are indeed probabilities.

* The first criteria is that all probabilities sum to one.

`p_matrix_cycle` returns a three dimensional array so we need to sum across the columns to give the total probability of transitioning from a state.
The base R `apply` function can do this if we provide the 'margins' i.e. the dimensions to apply the function over.
This should return a matrix of all ones which we can simplify with the `c()` command so that we can compare with what we expect.

```{r eval=FALSE}
test_that("probabilities", {
  res <- p_matrix_cycle(p_matrix, age = 40, cycle = 1)
  
  sum_from <- apply(res, MARGIN = c(1,3), sum)
  
  expect_equal(c(sum_from), rep(1, times = 6))
})
```

* The second criteria is that each probability is between zero and one.

We can take advantage of how R vectorises things.
If we make a logical conditional statement on the array then R applies this element-wise so that each probability is individually assessed and the format of the original array is maintained.
This means that if we execute `res <= 1` R returns a 3 by 3 by 2 array of `TRUE` or `FALSE` entries.
We can now simply test if `all` of the entries are true.

```{r eval=FALSE}
test_that("probabilities", {
  res <- p_matrix_cycle(p_matrix, age = 40, cycle = 1)
  
  expect_true(all(res<=1))
  expect_true(all(res>=0))
})
```

__Notice that we could have alternatively used the same approach with `all()` for the total probabilities summing to one. Can you see how?__

There are many more `expect_*` functions to try and you can even make your own custom ones.
Unit testing is a bit of an art and it is not necessary to test absolutely everything although it is also not uncommon for the unit tests to be many times longer than the code they are testing!
