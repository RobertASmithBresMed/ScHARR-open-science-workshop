# Introduction to cost-effectiveness Markov model

The model used throughout this workshop is based on a cost-effectiveness
analysis done in the following paper:

-   Briggs A, Sculpher M. Introducing Markov models for economic
    evaluation. PharmacoEconomics 1998; 13(4): 397-409.

-   Briggs AH. Handling uncertainty in cost-effectiveness models.
    PharmacoEconomics 2000 May;17(5):479-500.

These are available in the `1-intro_Markov_model` folder in the GitHub
repo folder `contents/resources`.

**Download the repo .zip folder and take a look at the papers.**

A Microsoft Excel implementation of this model was also made available
and is in the practical folder too, called `Markov_model.xlsm`.

**Open this up and have a look around to understand how it works and how
it matches up with the journal papers.**

Finally, we have recreated this Excel model in R with the script
`Markov_model_script.R`.

**Open this up and see if you can understand how it matches with the
Excel model. Donâ€™t worry about the details just yet. We will be
revisiting this code throughout.**
